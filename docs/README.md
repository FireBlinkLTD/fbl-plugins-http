# Template Utility Functions

## Random User Agent

Allows to generate random user agent that mimics real ones. Under the hood is using [user-agents](https://www.npmjs.com/package/user-agents) node module. In fact it is just a proxy function. First argument of which can be ignored or provided as a filter according to the documentaiton of the library itself.

```js
// generate random user agent
$.http.randomUserAgent();

// generate random user agent for mobile browsers only
$.http.randomUserAgent({deviceCategory: 'mobile'});
```

**Example:**

```yaml
http:
  request:
    method: GET
    url: https://fireblink.com
    headers:
      user-agent: <%= $.http.randomUserAgent() %>
```
